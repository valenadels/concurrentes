Now I have lost my CD somewhere. Earlier I copied the content to my laptop. When I tried to install by copying to another CD/pendrive it didn't install.\n\nNow i am using Windows. But I would like to install Ubuntu, because everyone said that Linux/Ubuntu is an amazing OS.\n\nSo I searched in google for a solution. With Unetbootin, pendrive linux, I can make a bootable pendrive to install. But Unetbootin asks for an ISO-image. I did many experiment and wastes more than 9 CD's. I have no experience with that. Where can I get the ISO-image?\nActually, what is an ISO-image?"], "tags": ["usb", "usb-drive"]}
